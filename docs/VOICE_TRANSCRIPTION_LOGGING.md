# Voice Transcription Logging Added

## Overview
Added comprehensive logging to the voice command system to help debug and monitor voice recognition and command processing.

## Logging Added

### 1. Text Command Input Logging
**Location**: `send_text_command()` method
**Log Format**: `Text command received: '[command text]'`
**Example**: 
```
2025-05-29 20:55:44,863 - voice_commands - INFO - Text command received: 'Aida turn on the lights'
```

### 2. Voice Transcription Logging
**Location**: `_process_recorded_audio()` method
**Log Format**: `Voice transcribed: '[transcribed text]'`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:32,123 - voice_commands - INFO - Voice transcribed: 'Aida what time is it'
```

### 3. Wake Word Detection Logging
**Location**: `_process_wake_word_detection()` method
**Log Format**: `Wake word 'Aida' detected, entering command mode for 2 minutes`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:32,124 - voice_commands - INFO - Wake word 'Aida' detected, entering command mode for 2 minutes
```

### 4. Command Processing Logging
**Location**: `_process_wake_word_detection()` method
**Log Format**: `Processing command after wake word: '[command]'`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:32,124 - voice_commands - INFO - Processing command after wake word: what time is it
```

### 5. AI Command Sending Logging
**Location**: `_send_ai_command()` method
**Log Format**: `Sending AI command: '[command]'`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:32,125 - voice_commands - INFO - Sending AI command: what time is it
```

### 6. AI Response Logging
**Location**: `_send_ai_command()` method
**Log Format**: `AI response received: '[response preview]'`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:33,456 - voice_commands - INFO - AI response received: It's currently 3:45 PM. How can I assist you today?
```

### 7. Error Logging
**Various Locations**: Multiple error scenarios
**Examples**:
```
2025-05-29 21:05:32,789 - voice_commands - ERROR - Failed to read audio file /path/to/audio.wav: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
2025-05-29 21:05:33,012 - voice_commands - ERROR - Transcription error: 500 Internal Server Error
2025-05-29 21:05:33,234 - voice_commands - WARNING - No transcription received from audio
```

### 8. Wake Word Timeout Logging
**Location**: `_check_wake_word_timeout()` method
**Log Format**: `Wake word timeout expired, returning to wake word mode`
**Example**:
```
2025-05-29 21:07:32,125 - voice_commands - INFO - Wake word timeout expired, returning to wake word mode
```

## Benefits

### For Debugging:
- **Voice Recognition Issues**: See exactly what text was transcribed from speech
- **Wake Word Problems**: Monitor when wake word is detected/missed
- **Command Processing**: Track how commands flow through the system
- **Backend Communication**: Monitor requests and responses to/from AI backend

### For Monitoring:
- **Usage Patterns**: See what commands users are saying
- **System Health**: Monitor error rates and types
- **Performance**: Track response times (timestamps in logs)
- **Mode Changes**: Monitor transitions between wake word and command modes

## Log Levels Used
- **INFO**: Normal operation, transcriptions, commands, responses
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues (no transcription, audio cleanup errors)
- **ERROR**: Serious issues (file errors, network errors, backend errors)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging info (short audio clips, empty commands)

## Example Complete Flow
```
2025-05-29 21:05:30,123 - voice_commands - INFO - Voice activity detected, starting recording
2025-05-29 21:05:32,456 - voice_commands - INFO - End of speech detected, processing audio
2025-05-29 21:05:32,789 - voice_commands - INFO - Voice transcribed: 'Aida what time is it'
2025-05-29 21:05:32,790 - voice_commands - INFO - Wake word 'Aida' detected, entering command mode for 2 minutes
2025-05-29 21:05:32,791 - voice_commands - INFO - Processing command after wake word: what time is it
2025-05-29 21:05:32,792 - voice_commands - INFO - Sending AI command: what time is it
2025-05-29 21:05:33,123 - voice_commands - INFO - AI response received: It's currently 3:45 PM. How can I assist you today?
```

This comprehensive logging makes it easy to troubleshoot voice recognition issues and monitor the system's behavior in your room client logs.
