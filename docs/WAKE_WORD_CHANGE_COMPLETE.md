  - Added comprehensive "aida" variation detection
  - Added 14 built-in aida variations including:

    - `hey aida`, `hi aida`, `a i d a`
    - Phonetic and spelling variations

- **Created:** `/room-client/test_aida_wake_word.py`
  - Comprehensive verification test for the wake word change

## 🧪 Test Results

**All tests passed:** ✅ 9/9 (100% success rate)

### Detection Scenarios Verified:
- ✅ **Primary wake word:** "aida turn on lights"
- ✅ **Phonetic variations:** "ayda help me", "ada what time"
- ✅ **Natural speech:** "hey aida play music"
- ✅ **Spelling variations:** "aide set timer"
- ✅ **Backward compatibility:** "apartment play jazz" still works

## 🚀 Current Configuration

```json
{
  "wake_word": "aida",
  "wake_word_similarity_threshold": 0.6,
  "wake_word_phonetic_matching": true,
  "wake_word_variations": [
    "apartment",
    "apartement", 
    "appartment"
  ]
}
```
