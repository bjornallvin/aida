# Play BBC Radio 1 directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/radio/play \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomName": "The Roam", "stationName": "BBC Radio 1"}'

# Discover stations dynamically
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/radio/search/tunein \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "classical music", "limit": 10}'
```

### **TTS + Sonos Working**
```bash
